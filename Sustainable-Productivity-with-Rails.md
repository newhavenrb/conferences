**Presenter:** Xavier Shay

## Bio

> Xavier Shay recently emigrated from Australia to San Francisco to work on the engineering team at Square. Prior, he worked on large Ruby on Rails projects at The Conversation, NZX, Redbubble, and mentored many more. In 2010 he presented a world tour of a training course titled "Your Database Is Your Friend". He has been working with Ruby on Rails for half a decade, and has published and contributed to over 80 open source projects according to GitHub.

## Abstract

> Ruby on Rails claims to be "optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity." I strongly disagree with the latter assertion. In this talk I will channel my half decade of industry Rails experience into expounding this position and providing constructive feedback as to what needs to change---in both the framework and the community---before we can support this claim. I'll also cover practical techniques you can use to be sustainably productive on your own projects in the meantime.
