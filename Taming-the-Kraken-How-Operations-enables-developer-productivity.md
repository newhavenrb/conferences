## Abstract

> Are you having trouble launching new features because of friction between development and operations?  At CustomInk, we've reduced this friction by making changes to our teams, processes, and tools.  Come find out what we've been up to and learn how you can implement similar changes in your own environment.
>
> There's always a bit of tension when getting features from idea to production.  In this talk, we'll look at some of the changes CustomInk has made to reduce this friction and keep the new features coming.  Gone are the days of bi-monthly deploys, office pools dedicated to guessing when this deploy will be rolled back, and the ceremony surrounding the deploy-rollback-fix-deploy cycle.  Today, ideas flow from product managers to developers to production with ease thanks to a number of changes that we've made to our teams, processes and tools.
