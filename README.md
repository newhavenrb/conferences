RailsConf 2012 Notes
====================

You probably are meaning to look at [https://github.com/newhavenrb/railsconf2012/wiki](https://github.com/newhavenrb/railsconf2012/wiki).

The "code" repository is probably out of date relative to [the wiki](https://github.com/newhavenrb/railsconf2012/wiki) because it has to be pushed manually.  However, it is still useful for taking pull requests from people outside [newhaven.rb](http://www.newhavenrb.org/).
