## Notes

* This layout is just a suggestion.
* It's kinda based on how Wikipedia is organized (e.g. an "External Links" section)
* Bullet points might work well.  Paragraphs too.  Up to you.  :)
* This section is probably enough, but just in case here are some other ideas...

## Summary

* Don't have time to read the whole thing?
* Here are the takeaways.
* "This page in a nutshell."

## Discussion

* If some stuff is controversial, thought provoking, etc, we can have something like this.
* Kind of like "Talk" pages on Wikipedia.
