A crowd-sourced RailsConf wiki!  Working together is better.  :)

## "Let's make this the most public RailsConf ever!"

* This is like Wikipedia, but for RailsConf.
* Internet access generally sucks at conferences like this.  This wiki [works offline](https://github.com/newhavenrb/railsconf2012/wiki/_access); it's just a `git` repo full of Markdown files.
* It's more than just notes; we have summaries, discussions, slide/video/presenter links, mentioned gems, and more.  Miss a talk?  Can't remember the name of something?  We've got your back.

## [[Want to help?|How you can help]]

If you like the idea of a RailsConf wiki, please consider [[helping us|How you can help]]!  It can be *as simple as sharing a link for the wiki* (e.g., on Twitter), fixing a typo you happen to find, or [[any of our other ideas|How you can help]].

### Priorities

If you're looking for just one thing to do, here are some simple ideas:

* Share a link to this wiki
* Add [video links](http://www.confreaks.com/events/railsconf2012)
* Write summaries
* Anything you feel makes an improvement  :)
