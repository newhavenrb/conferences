## Abstract

> Thank you to the Rails community, from Cookpad and 15 million families.

## What is COOKPAD?

* Cookpad is probably the biggest Rails site you never heard of
* 15 million unique visitors per month, generating half a billion
  pageviews a month
* The site is trusted by 50% of women in Japan to find recipes for
  their families, wherever they are
* Founded in 1997, we now have around 100 employees, 40 being
  Engineers from 7 different countries - all using Ruby and Rails

## The COOKPAD Mission

* We know cooking with friends and family, sharing the moment, makes
  people smile
* If everyone starts using Cookpad and shares their experiences around
  cooking, we know it can enrich all our lives
* Our mission is literally: "to improve people's lives through cooking"
  and that mission has been successful in daily life in Japan

## COOKPAD in Daily Life

* It’s amazing to think that 50% of all women in Japan in their 20’s and
  30’s rely on Cookpad to find recipes for their families
* We want to inspire people everywhere to enjoy cooking more, by providing
  the tools and technologies to help them share and find new and interesting
recipes

## Why Sponsor RailsConf?
* We wanted to really say thank you to you, the Rails community, Ruby
  Central and sponsoring this event is a great way for us to start
showing our appreciation
* Cookpad has been built on Rails for 4 years
* We love the Rails framework and of course, the Ruby language
* Thanks to Rails, we’ve been able to quickly build features then
  measure and learn from users, while still writing beautiful ruby code.
* Lastly, in the past we haven't been as involved as I would like in the
  Rails community, we’ve been working hard to change that by open
sourcing some of our code and also actively contributing to other
projects we use - as a priority
* TOKYO Rails! please come and visit if you’re ever in Tokyo!

## Food for Thought

* What I really, really, love about Rails and Ruby is that the focus
  is on creating incredible value for its users - those users being us,
the developers using it every day
* it works really hard to get our of our way, and solve real problems
  for us, defintely improving our daily lives
* Simlarly, Cookpad’s incedible success is largely due to the focus on
  providing incredible value to our users, solving their real problem
of what to feed their families, and changing their daily lives for the
better
* so my take away for you is this; take your amazing skills, use this
  amazingly productive Rails framework we all love and are here to
celebrate, and build products that really change people’s daily lives
around you
* talk to the underserved, your non-technical friends, families,
  neighbours who aren’t sitting in front of their MacBooks all day like
many of us, and listen to problems they have in their daily lives that
you can help with
* together, we can make the world a better place!!

## THANK YOU ALL
* So, once again, a huge “Thank you” from myself, and everyone at
  Cookpad!
* Thanks to everyone here, the Rails community
* and a special thank you to Leah, Ben, Ruby Central, and everone else
  involved in organizing this great event
