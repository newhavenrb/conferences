## Abstract

> There’s all kinds of discussion on how to make test processes work, and how to make tests fast, but it sometimes seems like there’s not much discussion on how to make tests useful. What makes a BDD test valuable, in that it will save more time that it will cost in maintenance? I’ll claim that there are five things that you should look for in your tests: independence, repeatability, clarity, conciseness, and robustness. These features will make the tests easier to write, easier to verify, and easier to keep consistent as your application becomes more complicated. You’ll leave this talk ready and able to write great tests.
