> The Fabulous Five are back! Last year we blew your mind. This year we will blow your heart. Join us as we put on our robes and wizard hats and enchant you with witty banter, amusing anecdotes and live Q&A. We'll cover topics ranging from "best ruby interpreter" to "best ruby interpretive dance". Featuring Aaron "The Kissing  Bandit" Patterson, Ben "It's Bleything, not Bleything!" Bleything, Yosef "Totally Great" Mendelssohn, Jon "The Bear Brogrammer" Barnette, and Evan "Totes Not Creepy" Phoenix. Moderated by Rein Henrichs.
